## ABSTRACT
To create a functional Contest hosting website using Django that can
handle all types of contests and act as a link between organizers and
participants. It should also provide optional revenue for organizers
through advertisements. It should dynamically transition UI based on the
contest and so make it a more user-friendly interface.
Django uses the MVC programming paradigm that is Model View
Controller which makes adding new models and templates easier. Apart
from that Django has an inbuilt validation system that enables us to have
more control over the form fields. Also, Django is pretty secure due to
its PBKDF2SHA1 password hasher
Also, Django has many modules which give us more control over its
dynamic models, classes, forms, views and handling its admin interface
Further, we used materialize CSS for giving a glossy tint to our UI
which makes it appear more user friendly and futuristic.
